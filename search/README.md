# Core Search

This package focuses on implementing the search feature. The current plan is
implement simple search features such as:
- Lowercase input
- Break input by ., whitespace etc.
- Minimum 3 chars
- Generating hash by word

Something useful we could consider implementing could be:
- Top-k Approximate String Matching algorithm
